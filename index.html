                <h1> The Internet and its Archive </h1>
                We all know the classic saying "Nothing is ever lost on the internet", this is
                because people assume if they don't save something on the internet someone else would
                save it for them. This is however not the case always and this way of thinking is how a lot
                of older content gets lost to time. But where does most of the content that did get
                saved go? That's where the Internet Archive (or simply archive.org) comes in! Saving a variety of
                content from (and even not from) the internet. <br><br> The Internet Archive not only hosts and has
                saved more than <b style="background-color: #FFCD27; border-radius: 5px;">916 billion webpages</b> and
                <b style="background-color: #FAAC3B; border-radius: 5px;">43 million texts</b>, but also has saved a
                variety of
                other kinds of content too...
                <h1 class="text-center"> Archive.org's Other Saved Items </h1>
            </div>

            <div class="text-end col-6 p">
                <h1> Why it Matters? </h1>
                So if not all content is not saved on the internet, then how much of it has been lost already? Even
                without including everything from before 2013, around 38% of content on webpages have been lost from
                between 2013-2023. That is a small bit of information, art, and history gone in a decade. The
                internet Archive helps us lower that number.<br><br>The Internet Archive has a service called <b>The
                    Internet's Wayback Machine</b>, which is the closest thing we will get to a time machine on the
                internet.
                You can use the Wayback Machine to travel through the archives throughout the years of webpage you
                choose that was archived. This single service's archives alone have been used to find lost information,
                research topics, and even as evidence in court!

                The Internet Archive is also a non-profit, collaborative project, allowing anyone anywhere to pitch in
                and help
                it be that in the form of direct donations, donations of items, or working as a volunteer to help
                maintain it.<br><br> Over <b>1000 libraries</b> contributed books to be digitized, <b>30 million
                    users</b> registered accounts to help with their own contributions, well over <b>100 million
                    people</b> use it, and over <b>100,000 people</b> make donations to support the Internet Archive.

                <br>Well there you have it! From that one flash game you remember playing when the teacher wasn't looking,
                to one of the first flash edutainment sites that went defunct, to even decades of radio broadcasts! The
                Internet Archive welcomes all pieces of media to get safely stored and made available to anyone for
                decades to come.
